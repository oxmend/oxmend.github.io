Since the Hamas attacks of 7 October and the Israel-Hamas war, there have been huge increases in settler violence across the West Bank, with entire villages displaced. The Israeli government continues to approve the construction of thousands of new settlement units. Dror Etkes is Israel’s foremost expert on settlements. He will explain the situation in the West Bank, and how it relates to current developments in Israeli politics.

Dror Etkes is the founder and director of Israeli NGO Kerem Navot, which researches Israeli land and settlement policy in the West Bank. He is frequently cited in the Israeli and international media, has published dozens of reports and op-eds in the Hebrew- and English-language press and meets regularly with policymakers, diplomats and journalists. He previously founded and directed the "Settlement Policy Judicial Advocacy Projecxt" of the Israeli human rights NGO Yesh Din, and directed Peace Now’s Settlement Watch programme. He was raised in a religious household and attended the prestigious Himmelfarb High School. Following his army service, he travelled extensively in the United States, Europe, and Central America, before returning to Israel in 1996. He earned his BA in history from the Hebrew University.
