In the OxMEND meeting before the main event, there will be an opportunity to engage with Hamze and Magen in an informal setting, exchange experiences, ideas, and goals, and explore potential paths for activism. This is mainly aimed to those who want to get more involved in OxMEND, and we recommend attending the evening event as well. Spaces are limited, register here:
