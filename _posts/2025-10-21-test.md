A Land for All is a joint Israeli-Palestinian political initiative rooted in the lived reality of both peoples. Founded by those who experience the conflict not through headlines but through daily life, the movement dares to imagine a different future - one grounded in dignity, equality, and belonging for everyone.

The initiative offers a clear, practical, and implementable proposal:

Two sovereign states, Israel and Palestine, in one shared homeland.

This confederal model is based on international law, local needs, and hard-earned lessons from decades of failed negotiations. It envisions two sovereign states coexisting side by side, guided by shared principles of equality, freedom, and mutual recognition.

A Land for All was born from dialogue ‚Äî a series of conversations between Israeli journalist Meron Rappaport and Palestinian activist Awni Al-Mashni, who chose to imagine a political future beyond endless cycles of violence.

We invite you to join us for a unique opportunity to hear from Dr Rula Hardal, about her personal journey, her vision for peace and stability, and the urgent actions taking place in these critical days.
